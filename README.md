### hey!
i'm levy, an 18 year old front-end development curious. as i'm usually trying to learn new things, i might post some small (useless) coding projects here every once in a while. <br> <br>
as of now, i mostly dabble in 
<b> html</b>, <b> css</b>, <b> javascript</b> and occasionally <b> python</b>, but i plan to learn other languages and frameworks as i go on.
