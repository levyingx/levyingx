### hey!
i'm levy, an 18 year old front-end development curious. as i'm usually trying to learn new things, i might post some small (useless) coding projects here every once in a while. 
as of now, i mostly dabble in html, css, javascript, bootstrap and occasionally python, but i plan to learn other languages and frameworks as i go on.
